# CLAUDE.md <!-- version: v4.2 -->

## Maintenance Rule

**Whenever this file is modified:**
1. Increment the version number in the `<!-- version: vX.Y -->` tag on line 1 (bump minor by 0.1 each time: v1.1 → v1.2 → v1.3, etc. — only bump the major version when explicitly instructed, e.g. to v2.0 or v3.0)

---

## Git & Versioning

- **Repository:** https://github.com/technerrrd/combined-pdf-tex-scraping
- **Versioning scheme:** Minor version bumps of 0.1 per change (v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, …) until explicitly instructed to jump to a new major version (v2.0, v3.0, etc.)
- **Authentication:** Use configured Git/GitHub CLI credentials. Never request or store tokens in project files. Commit/push only when authorized by the user.

---

## Current primary pipeline (v4.2)

Read `README.md` for current commands and setup. `AGENTS.md` owns maintenance
instructions; `HANDOFF.md` records progress and validation.

The primary web-only pipeline reads chapter links, validates and caches HTML and
images by source URL, preserves typed scientific notation, writes TeX and themed
LyX, and compiles both PDFs. It stages each build and publishes only after all
required checks pass. Failed runs retain diagnostics and preserve existing output.

- CLI: `python stage0/scrape_chapters.py --links input/CHAPTER-LINKS --module Notes --title "Notes"`.
- Optional explicit reference: `--pdf input/reference.pdf`; no implicit PDF selection.
- Optional reference mapping: `--chapter-map input/chapter-map.json`, a list of
  `{chapter, start_page, end_page}` entries with inclusive one-based page ranges.
- Reference coverage must reach 95% by default for every selected chapter in parsed
  content and both compiled PDFs. Mapping never falls back to document position.
- Both LyX and pdfLaTeX are mandatory. Direct TeX uses its existing plain book
  preamble; LyX uses the existing Legrand theme. Currency uses `tfrupee`.
- HTML5 parsing, source ordering, bold spacing, lists and tables are preserved.
- Explicit HTML/Unicode scripts, LaTeX equations, MathJax scripts and supported
  Presentation MathML remain editable. Unknown math raises a review error.
- The primary path no longer flattens scientific notation to ASCII. Image formulas
  remain images. No equations are inferred from prose or transcribed from images.
- Generated pages use natural bottom spacing. Content images retain smaller
  source-requested sizes and are capped at about 52% text width and 30% usable
  page height without cropping, distortion, or source-order changes.
- Caches are URL-keyed. Legacy chapter-number caches remain for the fallback only.
- Test commands: `python -m pytest -q` and `python -m pytest -q -m integration`.

Real-site calibration still needs representative EduRev input and a reference PDF.
Coverage does not prove complete fidelity; inspect reports and rendered output.

## Inherited fallback specification

The remaining sections describe the retained PDF/DOCX fallback and historical
formatting requirements. Where historical primary-pipeline notes conflict with the
v4.1 rules above or `README.md`, the current primary rules take precedence.
Original Linux projects are separate and must not be modified by this project.

# Stage 0: Web Image Scrape (NEW in v3.0)

## Why

EduRev PDFs are pages printed from Firefox. Images that straddle a page break get
split into two halves, and Stage 1 carried complex split-detection logic to cope —
still imperfect. The **original EduRev web pages** host every content image full-size
on a CDN, in reading order, in server-rendered HTML (no JavaScript). Stage 0 fetches
those clean images so Stage 1 never has to deal with split halves.

## Input: `input/CHAPTER-LINKS`

One line per chapter: `<idx>\t<EduRev URL> - Chapter<N>`. The scraper extracts the
URL, the chapter number `<N>`, and the chapter name (from the URL slug).

## How `stage0/scrape_images.py` works

1. Parse `CHAPTER-LINKS` into ordered `{num, name, url}` entries.
2. `GET` each page with a desktop User-Agent (polite ~1.5s delay between pages).
3. Extract content image URLs by the path filter
   **`ApplicationImages/Temp/<UUID>_lg.jpg`** — this uniquely identifies uploaded
   content images. ALL page chrome (icons/ads/course thumbnails/favicons) lives on
   other CDN paths (`cdn_assets/`, `cdn_lib/`, `CourseImages/`, `..._icon.jpg`), so the
   single path filter cleanly separates content from junk. Dedupe, preserve order.
   **Do NOT scope to the visible content `<div>`** (`explr_htmlcnt_dv`) — it appears
   *after* the images in the markup, so scoping by it drops everything.
4. Download to `input/scraped/Chapter<N>/image1.jpg, image2.jpg, …` (numeric order so
   Stage 1's sort works). Skips files already present (cache).
5. Write `input/scraped/manifest.json` (`[{num, name, url, folder, image_count, files}]`)
   and print per-chapter counts, then **STOP** (review gate). Inspect/prune, then
   run Stage 1.

## Notes

- Dependency: `requests` (in the Stage 1 venv).
- Images are downloaded as-is; these EduRev JPEGs sometimes start with a DQT marker
  and lack a JFIF/EXIF header, which makes `python-docx` raise `UnrecognizedImageError`.
  Stage 1's `insert_image()` handles this by re-encoding through PIL on failure — do
  not remove that fallback.
- If a chapter's scrape fails or yields zero images, Stage 1 falls back to DOCX-zip
  images for the whole document (see Stage 1 image-source rule).

---

# Stage 1: PDF → DOCX

## Why Both Input Files Are Needed

These documents are EduRev teaching notes printed from Firefox to PDF, then converted to DOCX. This creates specific structural issues:

- **DOCX text is inaccessible:** All text lives inside text boxes/shapes which `python-docx` cannot read. DOCX paragraphs contain only images and empty lines — zero readable text.
- **PDF is the only text source:** All text must be extracted from the PDF using `pymupdf`.
- **Image source (v3.0):** Images come from **Stage 0 web scrape** (`input/scraped/`) when available — these are full-size and never split. If no scrape exists, Stage 1 falls back to the **DOCX zip** (legacy behavior). PDF images are never used as a source (they are sometimes split in half across page boundaries; the PDF only supplies image *positions*).

**Text:** Extract from PDF ONLY  
**Images:** Stage-0 scraped web images (primary) → DOCX zip (fallback). Never from the PDF.

**Workflow:** Build a brand new DOCX from scratch — text from PDF, images from `input/scraped/` (or DOCX zip), processed page by page in reading order. The PDF's image slots (page + reading-order position) determine *where* each image lands; the scraped list supplies *which* image (1:1, in document order).

## Chapter Detection and Processing

**Process:**
1. **Analyze document structure** — detect chapter boundaries by identifying Heading 1 text (19–21pt) containing "Chapter Notes:" or "Chapter Notes-" (colon or dash separator).
2. **Confirm with user** — before processing, report findings:
   - "Found 1 chapter: Chapter 12 - Beyond Earth"
   - "Found 3 chapters: Chapter 10, Chapter 11, Chapter 12"
   - Ask: "Process as single file or split into separate files per chapter?"
3. **Processing options:**
   - **Single file:** `converter.convert()`
   - **Split by chapter:** `converter.convert_chapters(chapters)` where `chapters` is a list of `{name, start_page, end_page, output_path}` dicts
   - **Output naming for splits:** `<Subject>-Ch<N>-<Chapter-Name>.docx` (e.g. `Class6-Ch1-Mindful-Eating.docx`)

## Formatting Specifications

### Font and Color
- **Font:** Times New Roman ONLY
- **Color:** `#000000` (black) throughout — strip all source colors and font families

### Heading Styles
- **Heading 1:** 16pt bold
- **Heading 2:** 14pt bold
- **Heading 3:** 12pt bold
- **Body / captions / table cells / bullets / numbered lists:** 12pt normal

### Page Layout
- **Page size:** A4 (11906 × 16838 DXA)
- **Margins:** 1080 DXA on all four sides (0.75 inches)
- **Line spacing:** Single
- **Paragraph spacing:** 0pt before, 8pt after

### Content Rules
- **Images:** Center-align all images
- **Page/section breaks:** Let content flow naturally — do not preserve original breaks
- **Tables:** Preserve structure; apply 12pt Times New Roman to all cells; simple grid borders (black, single line)

### Heading Detection (PDF font size → output heading)
- **19–21pt** → Heading 1 (16pt bold black). Covers 21pt colored section titles and 19.5pt black "Chapter Notes: …" / "Chapter Notes- …" headings (colon or dash separator)
- **16–17pt** → Heading 2 (14pt bold black). Range covers 16.5pt used in newer documents
- **~13.5pt + bold + standalone** → Heading 3 (12pt bold black)
- **~13.5pt normal** → Body text (12pt normal black)

### Elements to Strip
- **EduRev branding:** text containing "edurev" or "durev" (case-insensitive), images under 1KB, EduRev URLs, EduRev logo PNG (~301×112px)
- **Browser print artifacts:** "Firefox", `^\d+\s+of\s+\d+$` (page counter), `^\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{2},\s+\d{2}:\d{2}$` (timestamp)
- **MCQ blocks:** "MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION", "Try yourself:" (start marker), question text, "View Solution" (end marker), option labels A/B/C/D, "View More"
- **Headers and footers:** strip entirely
- **Hyperlinks:** convert to plain text
- **Footnotes and endnotes:** remove entirely
- **TOC / Index:** remove any auto-generated TOC pages (detect by `\.{3,}\s*\d+$` pattern)

## Technical Implementation

### Python Environment

```bash
source stage1/venv/bin/activate
# Dependencies: pymupdf>=1.23.0, python-docx>=1.1.0, Pillow>=10.0.0, requests (Stage 0)
```

### Image Source Resolution (v3.0)

Before building, Stage 1 picks an image source:
- **`convert()` (single combined file):** `_collect_all_scraped_images()` concatenates
  every chapter's `input/scraped/Chapter<N>/` images in `manifest.json` (document)
  order. If the manifest is missing or any folder is empty → falls back to DOCX-zip.
  The concatenated list is assigned 1:1 onto `active_slots_ordered`.
- **`convert_chapters()` (split files):** `_resolve_scraped_images()` maps each chapter
  to its scraped folder **positionally** (both the PDF chapters and the manifest are in
  document order — chapter *names* are only a sanity check, since PDF headings are
  sometimes truncated mid-line). Each chapter gets its own scraped deque, popped 1:1 at
  that chapter's PDF image slots. All-or-nothing: if any chapter can't resolve, the
  whole run falls back to DOCX-zip.

When scraped images are used, the split-detection/dimension-matching logic still runs
on the PDF to locate image *slots*, but scraped images are placed by simple in-order
pop (`_insert_scraped_image_item`) — no dimension matching, because they are clean and
never split.

### Implementation Approach

`convert_document_v4.py` builds a brand new DOCX from scratch:

1. **Resolve image source** — scraped web images (`input/scraped/`) if available, else
   **extract from DOCX zip** — unzip, read `word/media/`, sort by filename number; filter out files under 1KB (watermarks) and PNG files with 270–330 × 90–130px (EduRev logo).

2. **Pre-scan PDF images** — walk all pages with `pdf_doc.extract_image(xref)` to get pixel dimensions. Build `split_set` for: consecutive same-dimension slots (Firefox page-break splits) and logo-dimension slots. Build `pdf_img_dims` dict: `(page_num, xref) → (px_w, px_h, pdf_pt_w)`. Build the image queue (per-chapter scraped deques, or one DOCX `docx_queue`).

3. **Process PDF page by page** — for each page, extract text blocks AND image positions via `pymupdf`. Sort by y-coordinate. For text: skip artifacts and EduRev text, detect heading level, sanitize, add to document. For images: check split_set and queue.

4. **Image insertion (queue-based):**
   - If `(page_num, xref)` is in `split_set` → skip (Firefox split continuation)
   - **Scraped mode:** pop the next scraped image in order and insert (no dimension match)
   - **DOCX-zip mode:** flush orphan images (if front of queue doesn't dimension-match, pop and insert as orphan — handles images in shapes pymupdf doesn't enumerate), then pop and insert the matched image
   - After all pages: insert any remaining queued images (trailing — per chapter in scraped mode)
   - Insert with `space_before=Pt(0)`, `space_after=Pt(0)` — do NOT set `line_spacing_rule` on image paragraphs
   - **`insert_image()` re-encodes through PIL on `add_picture` failure** — scraped EduRev JPEGs may lack the JFIF/EXIF header python-docx requires. Keep this fallback.

5. **Image sizing** — `width = Inches(min(r.width / 72, 6.77))` where `6.77` is A4 content width (inches). Orphan/trailing images default to full content width. Only `width` is passed to `add_picture()`; height auto-scales.

6. **Text formatting** — detect heading levels from PDF font size/color/bold. Apply Times New Roman, black, correct sizes. Inline bold preserved via parallel `bold_chars` map (one entry per character from rawdict spans), propagated through ligature expansion, grouped into `runs = [(text, is_bold), …]`. Headings force all runs bold.

### Key Rules

- **Never read DOCX paragraphs for text** — all text is in text boxes. Use PDF exclusively.
- **Bold detection:** `is_bold = bool(span["flags"] & 16) or bool(_BOLD_FONT_RE.search(span.get("font", "")))` where `_BOLD_FONT_RE = re.compile(r'bold|black|heavy|semibold', re.IGNORECASE)`. Never rely on the flags bit alone — EduRev PDFs use `Lato-Black` (flags=0) for visually bold body text.
- **Run boundary spaces:** use `re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', seg)` without `.strip()` when building run segments — stripping drops boundary spaces and joins words.
- **MCQ state machine:** set `in_mcq_block=True` on "Try yourself:", clear on "View Solution". MCQ option texts appear AFTER "View Solution" in extraction order — track `after_option_label=True` when A/B/C/D label is seen and skip the next text block.
- **Split image detection:** identical pixel dimensions on consecutive pages = Firefox split. Do NOT use xref deduplication or y-position heuristics.

# Stage 2: DOCX → LyX/TeX

## Core Principle

**You are a transcription worker, not a content generator.**

Your sole job is to faithfully convert the content of the input DOCX into LaTeX/LyX format. Do not:
- Add, infer, or rewrite any text
- Fill in missing content or "improve" phrasing
- Generate section summaries, captions, or explanations

If something is unclear or missing in the source, flag it — do not invent a replacement.

### Subject Detection

Before beginning conversion, scan the document title, chapter heading, or metadata for subject indicators. If the subject is not immediately obvious, ask: **"Is this a Math or Science document?"** and wait for confirmation before applying subject-specific spacing rules.

### Input File Characteristics

Input DOCX files are clean and formatted (produced by Stage 1):
- **Text:** ALL paragraphs use `Normal` style — heading level is determined by **font size**, not style name
- **Font:** Times New Roman throughout — bold is **run-level**. `<w:b val="0"/>` = explicitly not bold. Many paragraphs have mixed bold/plain runs. Do **not** use bold as a heading indicator
- **Images:** Embedded inline, center-aligned
- **Tables:** Simple grid borders, 12pt Times New Roman cell text
- **No watermarks, headers/footers, or hyperlinks** — stripped in Stage 1
- **MCQ blocks are present** and must be formatted per MCQ Rules below

## Tool Chain

**Custom Python XML parser** (`convert.py`) reads `word/document.xml` directly from the DOCX ZIP.  
Pandoc is not used — it cannot reconstruct heading hierarchy because all paragraphs are `Normal` style.

### Font Size → Structure Mapping

| Font size (`w:sz`) | Point size | LaTeX output | LyX layout |
|--------------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 32 + `Chapter Notes:` prefix | 16pt | `\chapter{}` | `Chapter` |
| 32 | 16pt | `\section{}` | `Section` |
| 28 | 14pt | `\subsection{}` | `Subsection` |
| 24 | 12pt | body paragraph (`\par`) | `Standard` |
| other | varies | body paragraph (`\par`) | `Standard` |

**Chapter detection:** An sz=32 paragraph whose text matches `Chapter Notes: <name>` (case-insensitive) is treated as a chapter heading. The "Chapter Notes:" prefix is stripped; only `<name>` appears in the output. Document class is `book`.

**Single-chapter files** (no `Chapter Notes:` headings) still use `book` class.

## Numbering Rules

**Strip all original numbering prefixes** from heading and body text. Patterns stripped: `1.`, `1.1`, `1.6.9`, `Q1`, `Q1.`, `(a)`, `(i)`, `(1)`. LyX and LaTeX provide their own auto-numbering.

### Notes documents (default)

All sz=24 body paragraphs are **Standard paragraphs** — no enumerate, no numbering. Bold formatting preserved run-by-run.

**`.tex` body paragraph:**
```latex
\par Plain text here.
\par \textbf{Bold label:} Plain description here.
```

**`.lyx` body paragraph:**
```
\begin_layout Standard
Plain text here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\series bold
Bold label:
\series default
 Plain description here.
\end_layout
```

### Question bank documents

Enumerate blocks apply only when the document is a question bank (MCQ, short/long Q&A). In that case:
- **Strip all original numbering** — remove `Q1`, `2.`, `1.1`, `(a)`, etc.
- **Under every subsection**, open a fresh `enumerate` block immediately after the heading
- **Before the next subsection or section**, close the `enumerate` block

MCQ questions always use enumerate regardless of document type.

## MCQ Rules

### All formats
- **Strip all original option markers** — remove `(a)`, `(i)`, `1)`, `A.`, etc. from option text
- **NEVER wrap the option table in `\begin{center}`**
- The question itself is an `\item` in the enclosing `enumerate` block

### `.tex` format

```latex
\item \textbf{<QUESTION>}\\[0.13cm]
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.45\textwidth} p(0.45\textwidth)@{}}
$\square$ A) <OPTION_1> & $\square$ B) <OPTION_2> \\

```

```

### Assertion-Reasoning Lock

Every Assertion-Reasoning pair **must** be followed by these exact fixed options — never alter the wording.

**`.tex` format:**

```latex
\item \textbf{Assertion (A):} <ASSERTION TEXT>\\[0.06cm]
\textbf{Reason (R):} <REASON TEXT>\\[0.13cm]
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}@{}}

\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout
```

## Subject-Specific Spacing Rules

### Short vs Long Question Detection

The source document will explicitly label sections as **"Long Question Answers"** or **"Short Question Answers"** — use that heading to determine spacing. For **case-based questions**, treat as Short Question or MCQ as indicated in the question itself.

### IF MATH

Do **not** add rules or large vertical spaces.

| Type | `.tex` | `.lyx` |
|------|--------|--------|
| Regular question | `\item \textbf{<QUESTION>}` | `Enumerate` layout, bold via `\series bold` |
| True/False | `\item \textbf{<STATEMENT>} \hfill ________` | ERT for `\hfill ________` after bold text |

### IF SCIENCE

For every question that is **not** an MCQ or fill-in-the-blank, and where **no answer is provided** in the source text, append writing lines.

**Short questions — 1 rule line:**

`.tex`:
```latex
\item \textbf{<QUESTION>}
\par \vspace{0.3cm} \noindent\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt} \vspace{0.5cm}
```

`.lyx`:
```
\begin_layout Enumerate
\series bold
<QUESTION>
\series default

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\backslash
par
\backslash
vspace{0.3cm}
\backslash
noindent
\backslash
rule{
\backslash
linewidth}{0.4pt}
\backslash
vspace{0.5cm}
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout
```

**Long questions — 3 rule lines:**

`.tex`:
```latex
\item \textbf{<QUESTION>}
\par \vspace{0.3cm} \noindent\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}
\par \vspace{0.4cm} \noindent\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}
\par \vspace{0.4cm} \noindent\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt} \vspace{0.5cm}
```

`.lyx`:
```
\begin_layout Enumerate
\series bold
<QUESTION>
\series default

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\backslash
par
\backslash
vspace{0.3cm}
\backslash
noindent
\backslash
rule{
\backslash
linewidth}{0.4pt}
\backslash
par
\backslash
vspace{0.4cm}
\backslash
noindent
\backslash
rule{
\backslash
linewidth}{0.4pt}
\backslash
par
\backslash
vspace{0.4cm}
\backslash
noindent
\backslash
rule{
\backslash
linewidth}{0.4pt}
\backslash
vspace{0.5cm}
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout
```

**Fill in the blank** (Math and Science):

`.tex`: `\item \textbf{<TEXT> _________.}`  
`.lyx`: `Enumerate` layout, bold text, underscores inline

**True/False** (Math and Science):

`.tex`: `\item \textbf{<STATEMENT>} \hfill ________`  
`.lyx`:
```
\begin_layout Enumerate
\series bold
<STATEMENT>
\series default

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\backslash
hfill ________
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout
```

## Math & Currency Lock

- **Math:** Wrap all mathematical expressions, variables, and equations in `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (display). Do NOT wrap plain numeric text like years or counts.
- **Currency:** Convert all ₹, Rs., and INR to `\rupee~<amount>` (e.g. ₹250 → `\rupee~250`)
- **No image transcription:** Strictly forbidden from transcribing text or formulas found inside an image. **Exception:** tables inside images may be transcribed.

**`.lyx` math format:**

Inline: `\begin_inset Formula $<MATH>$\n\end_inset`  
Display: `\begin_inset Formula \n$$<MATH>$$\n\end_inset`

## Automated Image Numbering & Smart Scaling

`convert.py` extracts images and names them automatically (`image1.png`, `image2.jpeg`, etc.). **Do not rename them.** Map each image to its assigned filename in document order.

**Sizing:** Read rendered display size from DOCX XML (`<wp:extent cx="..." cy="..."/>`, in EMUs where 914400 EMU = 1 inch). Pick the closest width from: `0.25`, `0.4`, `0.5`, `0.6`, `0.75`. Do not use raw pixel dimensions.

**`.tex` figure block (no `\caption{}`):**
```latex
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=<CHOSEN_SCALE>\textwidth]{<filename>}
\end{figure}
```

**`.lyx` figure block (no caption, inline — no float wrapper):**
```
\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename media/<filename>
	width <SCALE>text%
\end_inset

\end_layout
```

Scale mapping for `.lyx`: `0.25` → `25text%`, `0.4` → `40text%`, `0.5` → `50text%`, `0.6` → `60text%`, `0.75` → `75text%`

## No Image Hallucination

**Never** insert a figure block for an image that does not exist in the source document. Only reference images explicitly present in the user-provided source text.

## Table Transcription Exception

You are allowed to transcribe tables (including those originally presented as images) into standard LaTeX `tabular` environments.

## Answer/Solution Exception

If the source text contains `Ans:`, `Answer:`, or `Solution:`, treat it as provided content. Place it immediately after the question item.

**`.tex`:** `\par \textit{Ans: <TRANSCRIPT_CONTENT>}`

**`.lyx`:**
```
\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Ans: <TRANSCRIPT_CONTENT>
\shape default

\end_layout
```

**Critical:** Do **not** append writing lines (`\rule`) or `\vspace` when an answer is already present in the source.

## Rule Priority Order

When multiple rules could apply, use this precedence (highest wins):

1. **Answer/Solution Exception** — answer present → no writing lines, ever
2. **MCQ format** — A/B/C/D options present → use MCQ grid, no writing lines
3. **Fill-in-the-blank** — question has blanks → use underscores, no writing lines
4. **Case-based question** — explicitly stated → follow Short/Long as indicated in the question
5. **Section heading** — "Long Question Answers" / "Short Question Answers" in source
6. **Subject default** — Math: no lines; Science: short = 1 rule, long = 3 rules

## Stage 2 Implementation Notes

- Skip temp files matching `~$*.docx` (created by Word when a file is open)
- Place DOCX files to convert directly in `stage2/` — do not read from subdirectories
- Log to `stage2/logs/convert_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` and echo to terminal
- Output dir `stage2/output/<stem>/` is created if it does not exist

## Verification

1. Copy a DOCX from `stage1/output/` into `stage2/`
2. Run `python stage2/convert.py`
3. Open `stage2/output/<name>/<name>.tex` — verify headings, body text, image references
4. Open `stage2/output/<name>/<name>.lyx` directly in LyX (File → Open)
5. Confirm images are in `stage2/output/<name>/media/` and referenced correctly

## Required LaTeX Packages

Add to your document preamble in LyX via **Document → Settings → LaTeX Preamble**:
